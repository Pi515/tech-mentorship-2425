# Lesson Planning Todo List

### Preparation
* [ ] Define primary/secondary instructors
* [ ] Is previous lesson's review available?
* [ ] Check `/assets/unit-{}-base.pptx`
* [ ] Note key learning objectives and terminology for slide deck
* [ ] Refine lesson exercises - can previous `/assets` exercises be reused/repurposed?
* [ ] Lesson materials
  * [ ] Standardize slides (ex. terminology icon, exercise icon, etc.)
  * [ ] First time primary/secondary this year? Include an intro slide about yourself!
  * [ ] Prepare exercises and review code
* [ ] Public lesson PR submissions
  * [ ] `readme.md` - fill in any blanks
  * [ ] `lesson.pptx` - remove anything that shouldn't be public (confidential info)
  * [ ] `review.pptx` - pay it forward to the next instructors!
  * [ ] `.py` files (submit solutions to private instructor repo)

### Day of Lesson
* [ ] Are student WiFi access credentials available? (if not, notify in teams ASAP)
* [ ] Is previous lesson review accounted for?
* [ ] Can supporting instructors help you?
  * [ ] Move desks?
  * [ ] Put students into groups?
  * [ ] Specific pairing strategies? (ex. each instructor focus on 2-3 students?)
